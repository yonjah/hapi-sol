This project participates in the Responsible Disclosure Policy program for the Node.js Security Ecosystem.

# Responsible Disclosure Policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect the project and its users from security vulnerabilities discovered in the projectâ€™s scope by employing a process where vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period to allow patching the vulnerability. 

All security bugs are taken seriously and are considered as top priority. 
Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
